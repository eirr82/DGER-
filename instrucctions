Instructions to use the application

DGE Ebayes Analyzer is an online app to perform an analysis to a  differential expression genes microarrays experiment, 
currently the app only analize data from Affymetryx CLARIOM S Human Arrays, in the future we will add more types of arrays
and organisms

This app uses the "Empirical Bayes Method from limma(Linear Models for Microarray Data), R package to calculate the expression
of the genes

Due to a incompatibilities with the online platform, DGER isn't working online with all funcionalities(GO and GSEA analysis). If you
need all funcionalities you can install the app in your local machine from github repository and follow the instructions for
install in your machine, the repository itself have three datasets to run a demo

Also you can download all de data from DGE analysis for further analysis with other tools

How to use it?

This section provides a short guide to run the DGE analysis

Data Input section
In the  Data input section, the user have to provide the following data to run the  analysis
In the CEL FILES section, the user have to provide the array data(CELFILES)
In the Targets section, the user have to provide the customs targets file in csv format
The custom targets file must be as follows:

-FileNames column with the CEL files name
-Group column with the group of each sample of the experiment
-Name column with an alias for CEL files(for better results understanding)
-PlotColor column indicating wich color the user wants to represent the groups for plotting purposes
 
 Quality Control
 
 The quality control section runs a quality control on the microarray data, on the raw data,  and the normalized data:
 
 Normalization of the samples is done with,"RMA"method.
 
 The quality control includes the following plots:
 
 -Histogram of arrays intensities(only for rawdata)
 -Boxplot
 -Dendogram
 -PCA Analysis
 
 DGE section
 
 DGE section is divided in two sections, one for one group comparison, and another for an experiments with more than two 
 group to compare(max 6 groups for three comparisons).
 In the DGE section in the select groups tab the user must indicate on wich groups run the analysis, after loading the groups
 the app shows the matrix and contrasts designed to perform the ebayes method.
 
 Results section
 
 This section shows the results of the DGE analysis, user must navigate to the proper tab(one or  multiple groups).
 The One Group Results Tab includes the following outputs:
 
 Ebayes results in table format with the expression of the genes
 Selected Genes,the table with the selected genes to perform the GO analysis.
 The User can control the Adjust.P.Value to filter results and the number of genes
 Volcano plot
 Heatmap
 
 The multiple groups tab includes the following outputs:
  
 Ebayes results in table format. The usar can control wich of the comparations see
 Selected Genes,the table with the selected genes to perform the GO analysis.
 The User can control the Adjust.P.Value to filter results and the number of genes
 Volcano plot
 Heatmap
 Summary of decide tests function to select the up and down regulated genes
 Venn Diagram with the result of decide tests
 A list with the names of the genes selected by decision tests
 
 All the plots and tables can be dowloaded in .png format for images and .CSV for tables
